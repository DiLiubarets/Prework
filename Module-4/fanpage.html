            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of
            the terrestrial planets. The Earth is the only
            planet in our solar system not to be named after a Greek or Roman deity. The Earth was formed approximately
            4.54
            billion years ago and is the only known planet to support life.

    <h3> Top facts about Earth</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p> <strong>The Earths rotation is gradually slowing.</strong>
                <br>
                This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years,
                although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our
                days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day
                will have increased to 25 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>The Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe.</strong>
                <br>
                Due to the apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their viewpoint, ancient scientists
                insisted that the Earth remained static, whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits
                around
                it. Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus,
                though
                this is also not the case.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Earth has a powerful magnetic field.</strong>
                <br>
                This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This
                field
                protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong> There is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth.</strong>
                <br>
                As a percentage of the size of the body it orbits, the Moon is the largest satellite of any planet in
                our
                solar system. In real terms, however, it is only the fifth largest natural satellite.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Earth is the only planet not named after a god.</strong>
                <br>
                The other seven planets in our solar system are all named after Roman gods or goddesses. Although only

                    Venus</a>, <a href="https://space-facts.com/mars/"> Mars </a>, <a

                    Saturn </a> were named during ancient times, because they were visible to the naked eye, the Roman
                method of naming planets was retained after the discovery of <a
